## How to use

Currently this allows you to view a playlist as album art, and play specific albums. Kinda like browsing records in a record store and then listening to them.

1. Visit root url and authorise Spotify.
1. Click on a playlist to select it.
1. Click `Show Albums`.
1. Playlist will load - large playlists (1000+) take time.
1. View album cover art in a grid.
1. Click an album to show date, artist and title.
1. Click `Play` to play that album in Spotify.

Playback is controlled via Spotify, so you can skip, shuffle, etc as normal.
